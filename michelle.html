                <p align="center">Sensei Michelle has been training since she was 9yrs old and has been teaching for around twenty years.
    She has studied a variety of styles including Judo and Ju-Jitsu. Michelle finally settled for training with Professor Smith in his own style of Sokudo in 1984 and started teaching the style in 1991.<br/>
    Since then Michelle has taught and trained thousands of students both in the UK and Europe and has been involved in the delivery of coaching courses  as an assistant to Professor Smith.<br/>
    Martial arts has always been a major part of Michelle's life and infact met and married her husband Rex in 1991 at the club.
    More recently Michelle and Rex together with their senior instructor Professor Smith, founded The Nippon Dai Martial Arts Academy in Blackburn, which in a very successful 10 years has earned Centre of Excellence status from the Nippon Dai National Governing Body and has also become the National Coaching Centre for the Nippon Dai.<br/>
    As the academy has developed and produced other instructors, Michelle has found that she is able to turn her attentions to other avenues and has focused on delivering martial arts in schools.  This is where Organised Chaos comes in, although in its infancy this new venture is showing huge promise and Michelle hopes to keep delivering martial arts for many years to come.</p>
